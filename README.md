Numerical Simulation of Quantize Vortices in Helium II

Bellow is a SMALL preview of our results.

Plot of velocity vs radius of one loop in T = 1.3 K. We can see that simulation match the theory.

Zoom of the single loop in T = 1.3 K. We can see the Kelvin waves.

Here we were testing the colision of the two loops (again T = 1.3 K).

Here we were testing the interaction of the two loops (again T = 1.3 K).

Plot of total length and density of vortices in time inside the counterflow (10 cm/s) with periodic boundary condition. Scaling of vortex density with counterflow velocity match the experimental results.
