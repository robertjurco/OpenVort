This repository contains the code used in my Bachelor's thesis titled "Simulations of quantum turbulence in thermal counterflow of superfluid helium using the vortex filament method". The code is open-source and free to use for any purpose, with proper attribution.

The attached Bachelor's thesis serves as the primary documentation for this code. It provides a detailed explanation of the methods used and the results obtained. Please refer to it for a comprehensive understanding of the project.

Below is an example of the turbulence generated using this code. Please note that results may vary based on the specific parameters and initial conditions used in the simulation.

Please note that while every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of this code, it is provided "as is" and I make no guarantees regarding its functionality. I encourage users to verify the results independently and use this code responsibly.
